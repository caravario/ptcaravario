<td><font face="patrick hand" size=4 color=black>Mesut Özil (German pronunciation: [ˈmeːzut ˈøːzil], Turkish: [meˈsut œˈzil]; born 15 October 1988)
is a German professional footballer who plays as an attacking midfielder for Süper Lig club Fenerbahçe. Özil is known for his technical skills, 
creativity, passing skills, and vision.[2] He can also play as a wide midfielder.Born and raised in Gelsenkirchen, Özil began his senior club 
career playing for hometown club Schalke 04, before signing with Werder Bremen in 2008, aged 19. After winning the DFB-Pokal in his first season, 
his individual performances led to a move to Real Madrid in 2010.[3] There, he helped the club win a La Liga title, and ranked first in league 
assists for three straight seasons.[4] In 2013, Özil was the subject of a then-club record association football transfer when he signed for 
Arsenal in a transfer worth up to £42.5 million (€50 million), becoming the most expensive German player ever at the time. In England, he 
won three FA Cups and helped end Arsenal's nine-year trophy drought, while recording the second most assists ever (19) in a Premier League season. 
In 2021, Özil joined Fenerbahçe on a free transfer.[5]</td>
