<td><font face="patrick hand" size=4 color=black>Xavier Hernández Creus (Catalan: [ˈʃaβi əɾˈnandəs ˈkɾɛws], Spanish: [ˈtʃaβi eɾˈnandeθ ˈkɾews]; 
born 25 January 1980), known as Xavi, is a Spanish professional football manager and former player who is the manager of Qatar Stars League 
club Al Sadd. Widely considered one of the best midfielders of all time,[3][4] Xavi is renowned for his passing, vision, ball retention, 
and positioning.[5][6][7][8] Xavi joined La Masia, the Barcelona youth academy, at age 11, and made his first-team debut against Mallorca 
in August 1998. In all, he played 767 official matches, a former club record–now held by Lionel Messi–and scored 85 goals. Xavi is the first 
player in the club's history to play 150 European and FIFA Club World Cup matches combined.[9] With Barcelona, Xavi won eight La Liga titles 
and four UEFA Champions League titles. Xavi came third in the 2009 FIFA World Player of the Year, followed by third place for its successor 
award, the FIFA Ballon d'Or, in 2010 and 2011. In 2011, he was runner up to Lionel Messi for the UEFA Best Player in Europe Award. In 2015, 
he departed Barcelona for Al Sadd, where he won four trophies before retiring in 2019. He is one of the few recorded players to have made 
over 1,000 professional career appearances.</td>
