<td><font face="patrick hand" size=4 color=black>Paul Labile Pogba (born 15 March 1993) is a French professional 
footballer who plays for Premier League club Manchester United and the France national team. He operates primarily 
as a central midfielder, but can also be deployed as an left winger, attacking midfielder, defensive midfielder and deep-lying playmaker.[4]
Born in Lagny-sur-Marne, Pogba joined the youth team of Ligue 1 side Le Havre in 2007, before a protracted transfer 
brought him to Manchester United two years later. After beginning his senior career with Manchester United two years later, 
limited appearances persuaded him to depart to join Italian side Juventus on a free transfer in 2012, where he helped the club 
to four consecutive Serie A titles, as well as two Coppa Italia and two Supercoppa Italiana titles. During his time in Italy, 
Pogba further established himself as one of the most promising young players in the world and received the Golden Boy award in 
2013, followed by the Bravo Award in 2014. In 2016, Pogba was named to the 2015 UEFA Team of the Year, as well as the 2015 FIFA 
FIFPro World XI, after helping Juventus to the 2015 UEFA Champions League Final, their first in 12 years.</td>
