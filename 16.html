<td><font face="patrick hand" size=4 color=black>Toni Kroos (born 4 January 1990) is a German professional footballer 
who plays as a midfielder for La Liga club Real Madrid. Kroos plays mainly as a central midfielder, but has also been 
deployed as a deep-lying playmaker in his career. Known for his vision, passing, creativity, crossing and set-piece 
ability,[4][5] Kroos is widely regarded as one of the best midfielders of his generation.[6]
Kroos began his senior club career playing for Bayern Munich, where he made his debut at age 17 in 2007. He was sparingly 
used, and opted for an 18-month loan spell at fellow Bundesliga side Bayer Leverkusen, where he became a key contributor, 
and returned to his parent club with an increased profile in 2010. With Bayern, Kroos won two consecutive league titles, 
a UEFA Champions League title, two DFB-Pokal titles, and was voted into the league team of the season three times. In 2014, 
he joined Real Madrid in a transfer worth â‚¬25 million.[7]</td>
