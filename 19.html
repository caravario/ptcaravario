<td><font face="patrick hand" size=4 color=black>Philip Walter Foden (born 28 May 2000) is an English professional footballer 
who plays as a midfielder for Premier League club Manchester City and the England national team.
Foden's breakthrough into professional football came in 2017 when he won the FIFA U-17 World Cup Golden Ball award following 
England's successful Under-17 World Cup campaign. He made his debut for City during the same year and in December was named 
BBC Young Sports Personality of the Year.
Foden has since made over 100 appearances for the club, winning eight honours including becoming the youngest recipient of a 
Premier League winners' medal.[4] In 2019, he won a second Premier League and became the club's youngest-ever goalscorer in 
the UEFA Champions League, and is the youngest English player to both start a match and score in the knockout stages of the 
competition. In 2021, he was named as the Premier League Young Player of the Season and the PFA Young Player of the Year.</td>
