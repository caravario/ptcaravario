<td><font face="patrick hand" size=4 color=black>Ángel Fabián di María (born 14 February 1988) is an Argentine professional 
footballer who plays for Ligue 1 club Paris Saint-Germain and the Argentina national team. He can play as either a winger or 
attacking midfielder. He is often regarded to be one of the world’s top wingers.[4][5]
Di María began his career with Rosario Central, but came into prominence at Benfica after signing for the club in 2007, aged 19. 
He helped Benfica win a Primeira Liga championship, the club's first in five years, and two Taça da Liga titles. In 2010, Di María 
moved to Spanish club Real Madrid in a transfer worth €25 million, where he won a La Liga title and the UEFA Champions League. 
He subsequently signed for Manchester United in 2014 in a then-British record deal worth £59.7 million (€75.6 million), but left a 
year later to join Paris Saint-Germain. In France, Di María won four league titles, five Coupe de France and four Coupe de la Ligue,
which includes three domestic quadruples, and helped the club reach its first Champions League Final. He is also the club's eight-highest 
goalscorer and all-time leader in assists.</td>
