<td><font face="patrick hand" size=4 color=black>Robert Lewandowski (Polish pronunciation: [ˈrɔbɛrt lɛvanˈdɔfskʲi] (About this soundlisten); 
born 21 August 1988) is a Polish professional footballer who plays as a striker for Bundesliga club Bayern Munich and is the captain of the 
Poland national team. Recognized for his positioning, technique and finishing, Lewandowski is considered one of the best strikers of all time, 
as well as one of the most successful players in Bundesliga history.[4] He has scored over 500 senior career goals for club and country.
After being the top scorer in the third and second tiers of Polish football with Znicz Pruszków, Lewandowski moved to top-flight Lech Poznań, 
helping the team win the 2009–10 Ekstraklasa. In 2010, he transferred to Borussia Dortmund, where he won honours including two consecutive 
Bundesliga titles and the league's top goalscorer award. In 2013, he also featured with Dortmund in the 2013 UEFA Champions League Final. 
Prior to the start of the 2014–15 season, Lewandowski agreed to join Dortmund's domestic rivals, Bayern Munich, on a free transfer. In Munich, 
he has won the Bundesliga title in each of his first seven seasons. Lewandowski was integral in Bayern's UEFA Champions League win in 2019–20 
as part of a treble. He is one of only two players, alongside Johan Cruyff, to achieve the European treble, while being the highest goalscorer 
in all three competitions, and first to do it as the sole top scorer.</td>
