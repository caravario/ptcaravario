who plays as a central midfielder for Premier League club Chelsea and the France national team.[4] Considered by many 
to be one of the world's best midfielders, Kanté is widely praised for his work rate and defensive acumen.[5][6]

played an entire season in the third division the following year. After that he joined Ligue 2 side Caen on a free 
transfer, finished third and won promotion to Ligue 1. He stayed with the club for one more year.</td>
