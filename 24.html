<td><font face="patrick hand" size=4 color=black>Mohamed Salah Hamed Mahrous Ghaly (Arabic: محمد صلاح حامد محروس غالى‎, Egyptian Arabic pronunciation: 
[mæˈħam.mæd sˤɑˈlɑːħ ˈɣæːli]; born 15 June 1992) is an Egyptian professional footballer who plays as a forward for Premier League club 
Liverpool and captains the Egypt national team. Considered one of the best players in the world,[6][7] he is known for his finishing, dribbling, and speed.
Salah started his senior career with Egyptian club Al Mokawloon, departing shortly thereafter to join Swiss side Basel for an undisclosed fee. 
In Switzerland, his performances attracted Premier League side Chelsea, who signed him in 2014 for a reported fee of £11 million. However, 
he was used sparingly in his debut season and was allowed to leave on loan to Serie A clubs Fiorentina and Roma, with the latter eventually 
signing him permanently for €15 million. Following his role in helping Roma to a second-placed finish and a club record points tally in 2017, 
Salah returned to the Premier League to sign for Liverpool for a then club-record fee of £36.9 million.</td>
