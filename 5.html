<td><font face="patrick hand" size=4 color=black>Sergio Leonel Agüero del Castillo (born 2 June 1988), 
also known as Kun Agüero,[5] is an Argentine professional footballer who plays as a striker for La Liga 
club Barcelona and the Argentina national team. He wears "Kun" on his shirt, a childhood nickname based 
on the title character from the cartoon Kum-Kum.[6] He is considered one of the best strikers of his 
generation and one of the best players in the history of the Premier League, during his decade-long 
association with Manchester City.[7][8][9] Agüero began his career at the Argentine Independiente where, 
on 5 July 2003, he became the youngest player to play in the Argentine Primera División at 15 years and 
35 days, breaking the 27 year record previously set by Diego Maradona. In 2006, Agüero moved to La Liga 
club Atlético Madrid in a transfer worth €23 million, establishing himself as one of the world's best young 
players, winning the Don Balón, the Golden Boy, and the World Soccer Young Player of the Year. Agüero also 
won the UEFA Europa League and the UEFA Super Cup while in Madrid.</td>
