<td><font face="patrick hand" size=4 color=black>Romelu Menama Lukaku Bolingoli (Dutch pronunciation: [ˈroːmeːlu luˈkaːku]; born 13 May 1993)
is a Belgian professional footballer who plays as a striker for Premier League club Chelsea and the Belgium national team.
Lukaku began his senior club career playing for Anderlecht, where he won a Belgian Pro League title and finished as the league's top goalscorer. 
In 2011, he joined Chelsea in a transfer worth £10 million (€12 million), but limited playing time resulted in loans to West Bromwich Albion and 
Everton; in 2014, Lukaku signed with Everton in a then club-record transfer worth £28 million (€32 million), going onto finish as the league's 
second-top goalscorer. He subsequently signed with Manchester United in a transfer worth £75 million (€88 million), but after a breakdown in 
relations with the club, Lukaku departed for Inter Milan in 2019 in a club-record deal worth €80 million (£68.1 million), and won a Serie A 
title and Serie A Most Valuable Player.</td>
