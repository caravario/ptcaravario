<td><font face="patrick hand" size=4 color=black>Luka Modrić (Croatian pronunciation: [lûːka mǒːdritɕ];[4][5] born 9 September 1985) 
is a Croatian professional footballer who plays as a midfielder for Spanish club Real Madrid and captains the Croatia national team. 
He plays mainly as a central midfielder, but can also play as an attacking midfielder or as a defensive midfielder. He is widely 
regarded as one of the best midfielders of his generation,[nb 1] and the greatest Croatian footballer of all-time.[nb 2]
Born in Zadar,[6] Modrić's childhood coincided with the Croatian War of Independence which displaced his family.[7] In 2002, 
he was signed by Dinamo Zagreb at age 16, after showing promise with his hometown club NK Zadar's youth team. He continued 
his development in Zagreb, before spells on loan to Zrinjski Mostar and Inter Zaprešić. He made his debut for Dinamo in 2005 
and won three consecutive league titles and domestic cups, being named the Prva HNL Player of the Year in 2007. In 2008, 
he moved to Premier League club Tottenham Hotspur for a club-record transfer fee of £16.5 million, where he led Spurs to their 
first UEFA Champions League appearance in almost 50 years, reaching the quarter-finals of the 2010–11 tournament.</td>
